# Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds role-based dashboards to the PBL platform with three distinct dashboards for students, entrepreneurs, and admins.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Dashboard Controller (`controllers/dashboardController.js`)
- **studentDashboard**: Returns user info, skills, level, open projects, and available mock projects
- **entrepreneurDashboard**: Returns entrepreneur's projects with status tracking
- **adminDashboard**: Returns all users, projects, and mock projects for admin oversight

### 2. Dashboard Routes (`routes/dashboard.js`)
- `/api/dashboard/student` - Student dashboard (student role only)
- `/api/dashboard/entrepreneur` - Entrepreneur dashboard (entrepreneur role only)
- `/api/dashboard/admin` - Admin dashboard (admin role only)

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- Uses JWT authentication via `auth` middleware
- Role-based access control via `requireRole` middleware
- Each endpoint is protected and role-specific

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Dashboard Pages
- **StudentDashboard.jsx**: Shows user info, skills, available mock projects, and open real projects
- **EntrepreneurDashboard.jsx**: Shows project statistics and entrepreneur's project list
- **AdminDashboard.jsx**: Shows platform overview with user counts, project stats, and mock projects

### 2. Features
- **Loading States**: Spinner animations during data fetching
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layouts with Tailwind CSS
- **Professional UI**: Cards, tables, and status indicators

### 3. Navigation
- Updated App.jsx with role-based dashboard routes
- Added dashboard link to navigation bar
- Role-based redirects after login

### 4. Login Flow
- Updated Login.jsx with role-based redirects
- Improved error handling and UI
- Automatic navigation to appropriate dashboard after login

## API Endpoints

## Security Features
